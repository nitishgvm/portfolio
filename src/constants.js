HDFC Life faced a significant challenge in managing their call records due to the large volume (over 1 lakhs) generated weekly from various call centers. They used to store these records on physical hard drives in different locations, making it difficult to access and maintain them effectively. To address this, We suggested a solution of storing the records in the cloud using AWS S3 bucket, allowing easy access. We also created a user-friendly platform for our client to access and manage these records efficiently through a Call Center Dashboard Application.',
